# BROWNPAK

This is BROWNPAK. It can perform the following kinds of simulations:

- Energy minimization (also called structure relaxation) via steepest
  descent.
- Brownian dynamics (BD)
- Multiparticle collision dynamics (MPCD)

To get started see the [User Guide](https://saridut.github.io/BROWNPAK/page/index.html).
The API documentation, generated by [FORD](https://github.com/Fortran-FOSS-Programmers/ford),
is available [here](https://saridut.github.io/BROWNPAK).
